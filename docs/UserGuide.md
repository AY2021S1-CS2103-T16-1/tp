## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `find KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `find spicy`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g `add INDEX [QUANTITY]` can be used as `add 3 2` or as `add 3`.
* Friendly syntax is supported! For any command, typing the prefix of the command will already be recognized, unless there is any ambiguity. 
* E.g. `help` only requires the user to type `h` to be recognized, while `sort` will require user to at least type `so` since typing `s` by itself will conflict with another command `submit` (The commands
will be explained below. To minimize confusion, the whole command will be shown instead of the prefix.)
