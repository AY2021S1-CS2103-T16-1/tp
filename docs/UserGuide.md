## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `find spicy`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add INDEX [QUANTITY]` can be used as `add 3 2` or as `add 3`.
  
* Friendly syntax is supported! For any command, typing the prefix of the command will already be recognized, unless
there is any ambiguity. For example, `help` only requires the user to type `h` to be recognized, while `sort` will
require user to at least type `so` since typing `s` by itself will conflict with another command `submit` (The commands
will be explained below. To minimize confusion, the whole command will be shown instead of the prefix.

The application is divided into two modes, vendor mode and menu mode. Vendor mode is when a vendor is not yet selected,
