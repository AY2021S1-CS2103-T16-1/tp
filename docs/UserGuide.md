**Supper Strikers is a desktop application for managing your supper orders.** While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the latest `supperstrikers.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the jar to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SupperStrikers.

1. Open a command window. Run the java -version command to ensure you are using Java 11. If not, please install Java 11 to ensure you are able to safely launch the jar file.

1. Launch the jar file using the java -jar supperstrikers.jar command (do not use double-clicking). The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`vendor`** : List all the vendors available.
   * **`vendor 1`** : Select the first vendor to make a supper order for.
   * **`add 1 2`** : Adds two quantity of the item at the 1st index from the vendor's menu to your supper order.
   * **`remove 1 1`** : Removes 1 quantity of the item at the 1st index from your order.
   * **`preset save My First Preset`** : Saves your current order items locally as a preset with the name "My First Preset", which you can call it back easily by:
   * **`preset load My First Preset`** : Loads the preset with the name "My First Preset" to your supper strikers app!
   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.
   
1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find KEYWORD`, `KEYWORD` is a parameter which can be used as `find spicy`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add INDEX [QUANTITY]` can be used as `add 3 2` or as `add 3`.
  
* Friendly syntax is supported! For any command, typing the prefix of the command will already be recognized, unless
there is any ambiguity. For example, `help` only requires the user to type `h` to be recognized, while `sort` will
require user to at least type `so` since typing `s` by itself will conflict with another command `submit` (The commands
will be explained below. To minimize confusion, the whole command will be shown instead of the prefix.)

</div>

The application is divided into two modes, vendor mode and menu mode. Vendor mode is when a vendor is not yet selected,
as seen by the section on the left displaying a list of vendors. In vendor mode, only vendor
related commands can be executed. In menu mode, both vendor and menu commands can be executed.

See you next time! 

## Vendor related commands

Format: `vendor [INDEX]`

* If no `INDEX` is specified, it displays the list of all vendors and returns to vendor mode.
* If an `INDEX` is specified, the corresponding vendor is selected, and its menu will be shown.
